# MLOpsProduction
this code is ment to be run in the container of this repo: https://github.com/FabioSol/MLOpsAids.git which clones this repo.
The api of this repo should have a webhook to this other repo: https://github.com/FabioSol/AidsModel.git 

the idea is that the webhook enables continuous integration and the api updates the data on the Aids Model repo so that DS can work isolated.
